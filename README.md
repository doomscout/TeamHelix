Game basic Principles

Helix’ Game is a top down dungeon crawler with procedural content generation (PCG). Helix is a fast pace, turn based, single player game. 
A grid layout will be available with isometric view. The objective of the game is to beat the boss at the end to get a new spell with WASD keyboard controls in addition to save and reload the player character.
 Character death is permanent.
The game will be based on magic colors. Each color will be have a resistance and strength: for example red is strong against pink, but weak against blue. 
The colors will be a core part of strategic gameplay as both the map and the enemies as well as the spells in the game will be of a certain color. Colors are as follows: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, pink.
